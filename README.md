To run the application you need the pycryptodome library 

```
pip install pycryptodome
```
The file to be signed should be in the same directory as the python script.

If you want to validate the signature, the files "signature.txt" and "public_key.pem" should also be in this directory

After running the script you need to enter a file name along with its extension. Then choose whether you want to sign the file or validate the signature.
